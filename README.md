This repo consists of an api and a front-end app. 

## API
The api has a static endpoint which returns hotel related info. This can be executed by changing directory to the `/api` route and running `node index.js`

## APP
You first need to install all the node modules
`npm install`

Once completed you can run `ng serve -o` which should automatically open up a browser window with the app
